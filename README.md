# Jass_tournament
A small interface used to host a Jass tournament at my school.
# Re-use
If you want to use this code, feel free to do it.
The only requirement is that the tournament needs to have 8 teams of 2 people.
The first round, teams are chosen randomly to fight.
On the next two rounds, two teams that have the same number of win are chosen and play against each other.
